# CoalSIM 2025
Simulation of Coal Fired power generation unit (Version 2)

## Introduction

This simulation represents a rather basic model of a 150MW (gross)
single unit superheated Rankine cycle power plant with a pulverised fuel
coal fired boiler. It is not meant as a complete simulator training system, 
but just as a proof of concept of what is possible.\
\
The aim is to perform a cold start of the boiler and turbine and once
synchronised to the electrical grid increase load to the unit maximum of
approx. 150 MW. Once this load is reached a score will be given on your
performance, taking into account the fuel usage, auxiliary power
consumption and any environmental limits that have been exceeded. To
achieve a perfect score of 100% may require a few attempts.
